# About

These are my notes and program assignments for the [Machine Learning Engineering for Production
(MLOps) Specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/program/machine-learning-engineering-for-production-mlops/) offered by [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-engineering-for-production-mlops).

My review: 

- Course 1 is decent and Andrew Ng is really pleasant to listen to. It is similar to the [Full Stack Deep Learning](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/spring2021/) course by UC Berkeley, which gives even more practical tips while teaching the theory equally well. They sometimes focus on different aspects, though, so taking both is not wasted effort. If I would have to pick one, I would pick the Full Stack Deep Learning course.
- Course 2 is decent if you want to learn TensorFlow Extended and deal with structured data. However, the theory part rarely taught me new things. On top of that, I personally found some of the video lectures rather confusing in the sense of "Okay, what does he want to convey here?".
- Due to these experiences, I did not continue with course 3 and course 4.
